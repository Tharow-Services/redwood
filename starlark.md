# Starlark Scripting

Starlark is an embeddable scripting language based on Python.
Redwood uses the Go implementation from https://github.com/google/starlark-go.

It loads Starlark script files specified with `starlark-script` in the configuration,
collects the functions defined there, 
and calls the functions with certain names as it processes a request.
If there are multiple functions defined with the same name (in separate files),
they will be called in the order they were defined.

## An Example

If you want to use a Starlark script to turn on Google safe search,
put this in `/etc/redwood/safesearch.star`:

```python
def ssl_bump(session):
    if session.sni in ("www.google.com", "google.com"):
         session.server_addr = "forcesafesearch.google.com:443"
```

And add this line to `/etc/redwood/redwood.conf`:

    starlark-script /etc/redwood/safesearch.star

Each time Redwood intercepts an HTTPS connection, 
it will call the `ssl_bump` function you defined.
So if the Server Name Indication (SNI) of the connection is www.google.com or google.com,
it will connect to forcesafesearch.google.com instead.

## Functions You Can Define

### `ssl_bump`

When Redwood intercepts an HTTPS connection, it calls the `ssl_bump` function.
The function's parameter is a `TLSSession` object, 
which gives information about the connection and lets you customize how Redwood handles it.

The `TLSSession` object has the following attributes:

- `client_ip`: the client computer's IP address.

- `user`: the username that the client has authenticated with.

- `sni`: the Server Name Indication (SNI) from the TLS connection's client hello message.
  This is normaly the hostname from the URL the user typed into his browser.

- `server_addr`: the address (in host:port format) of the upstream server that Redwood will connect to.
  If you change this, it will connect to the server you specify.

- `source_ip`: the address of the network interface that should be used for the connection to the origin server.
  This is blank by default, but you can set it to control what network interface will 
  be used to connect to the origin server.

- `acls`: a set containing the ACL tags that have been assigned to the request. 
  If you modify the set, it can affect the action that Redwood takes.

- `scores`: a dictionary containing the category scores that have been assigned to the request.
  (The keys are strings, and the values are integers.)
  If you modify the dictionary, it can affect the action that Redwood takes.

- `action`: a string indicating what action Redwood will take for the connection.

- `possible_actions`: a tuple of strings, listing the values that may be assigned to `action`.

### `filter_request`

For each HTTP request that Redwood receives, it calls the `filter_request` function.
The function’s parameter is a `Request` object,
which gives information about the request and lets you customize how Redwood handles it.

The `Request` object has the following attributes:

- `client_ip`: the client computer's IP address.

- `user`: the username that the client has authenticated with.

- `method`: the HTTP method (`GET`, `POST`, etc.) of the request.

- `url`: the URL being fetched by the request.
  It can be changed to fetch a different URL.
  (But with HTTPS requests, you can't change what server it comes from;
  that would need to be done at the `ssl_bump` stage.)

- `host`: the server name from the URL or from the `Host` header.

- `path`: the request’s URL path. It can be changed to fetch a different URL.

- `header`: a dictionary containing the request’s HTTP headers.

- `query`: a dictionary containg the request’s URL query parameters.

- `acls`: a set containing the ACL tags that have been assigned to the request. 
  If you modify the set, it can affect the action that Redwood takes.

- `scores`: a dictionary containing the category scores that have been assigned to the request.
  (The keys are strings, and the values are integers.)
  If you modify the dictionary, it can affect the action that Redwood takes.

- `action`: a string indicating what action Redwood will take for the request.

- `possible_actions`: a tuple of strings, listing the values that may be assigned to `action`.

### `filter_response`

For each HTTP response that Redwood receives, it calls the `filter_response` function.
The function’s parameter is a `Response` object,
which gives information about the response and lets you customize how Redwood handles it.

The `Response` object has the following attributes:

- `request`: the Request object for the associated HTTP request.

- `status`: the HTTP status code.
  It can be changed to affect the status code the client receives.

- `body`: The response’s body content, as a string. Assigning to body replaces the
  response’s content. If the body is larger than `max-content-scan-self`, `body` will be `None`.

- `header`: a dictionary containing the response’s HTTP headers.

- `acls`: a set containing the ACL tags that have been assigned to the response.
  If you modify the set, it can affect the action that Redwood takes.

- `scores`: a dictionary containing the category scores that have been assigned to the response.
  (The keys are strings, and the values are integers.)
  If you modify the dictionary, it can affect the action that Redwood takes.

- `action`: a string indicating what action Redwood will take for the request.

- `possible_actions`: a tuple of strings, listing the values that may be assigned to `action`.

Other methods of `Response`:

- `thumbnail(500)`: returns a JPEG thumbnail of the response, no more than 500 pixels in width and height.
  If no thumbnail is available (either because the response body is not a supported image format,
  or because the body is too large), `thumbnail` returns `None`.
  The default self is 1000 pixels.

## Language and Library Notes

The Go implementation of Starlark has several features that are not present in the Java version.
Some of them are optional.
Redwood enables all the optional features (set, lambda, recursion, and reassigning global variables).
It imports the `json`, `math`, and `time` modules that are available in the Starlark REPL,
and several modules from github.com/qri-io/starlib (`base64`, `bsoup`, `csv`, `hash`, `html`, `http`, `re`, and `yaml`).

The output from Starlark functions (`print` statements and error tracebacks)
goes to a CSV log file specified with the `starlark-log` configuration option.

### Predefined Functions

- `lookup_host`: does a DNS lookup and returns the IP address.
  You can do the lookup with your system’s default DNS resolver (`lookup_host("www.google.com")`),
  or specify a specific DNS server to use (`lookup_host("www.google.com", "208.67.222.123")`).

- `lookup_addr`: does a reverse DNS lookup and returns the hostname.
  You can do the lookup with your system’s default DNS resolver(`lookup_addr("8.8.8.8")`),
  or specify a specific DNS server to use (`lookup_addr("8.8.8.8", "208.67.222.123")`).
  The trailing dot that is normally returned by a reverse DNS query is stripped off.
